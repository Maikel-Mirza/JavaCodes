As a developer you're not only responsible for writing code, but also just as importantly fixing the errors in your code.

Syntax errors:
Your code does not compile because there are incoherences with the code and the rules and written grammer of the language.



Runtime Errors:
You can compile the code but you cannot execute with the java virtual machine.
This is called a runtime error because it happens at run time not compile time
for example System.out.println(1/0);


Logic errors:
Occurs when a program does not perform the way it is intended to.
