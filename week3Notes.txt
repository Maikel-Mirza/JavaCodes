Methods:
-Usually you define methods first, either predefined or you can define your own method.
int method(x, y); //the value of these arguments willed be passed into the formal parameters and the it performs the operation and returns the result.

if a method/function returns nothing you need to set the return type to void

function can have no parameters as well.

anywhere in your code that you see that there is redundancy(you've written the code multiple times), bring that code into a single method so that you can improve the efficiency of the code.

Arrays:
//there are no static or dynamic arrays in java unlike c, c++, arrays static
Declaring Array Variables:
datatype[] arrayRefVar;
datatype arrayRefVar[];
double[] myList = new double[10];

Creating Arrays:
Example:
arrayRefVar = new datatype [arraySize];
myList = new double[10];
** you can declare and create the array at the same time

Can intialize arrays with rand

Assignment:
Q1)-we assume that the user defines a positive integer we dont need extra conditions to ensure
   - the sample run output format is a requirement!. My program needs to produce the same result.

Q2) display numbers in sorted order * just like the MethodDemo code examples. can use any sort function. use if statements to store the 3 numbers and sort the results.

Q3) we assume user enter integer dont need to prompt for it. Polindrame is when it reads the same from right to left as left to right.
make sure output is exactly like its written.

** we have to create a 15 min video explaining the answers that we made to the solutions to the assignment qustions. // A) this is the 1st deliverable
- dont just read the code back, explain the meaning of the code.
upload the link for your video in the comment box.

B) can only submit .java files ** submit only the .java files any other format will receive a grade of 0. // B) 2nd deliverable
* can resubmit the assignment once if nescessary (2 attempts total)
